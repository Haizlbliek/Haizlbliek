Hey y'all! I'm Haizlbliek!
I make the random ideas that occasionally pop into my head.

# Interests
My main interest is coding and game dev, but sometimes I do music.

I am part of a great team called the Goofy Goobers Studio (See External Links).

# Main Projects
I have been working on a Google Chrome extension for adding autocompletions to Glitch.com.
You can find it [Here](https://github.com/Haizlbliek/GlitchAutocompletions).
