Hey y'all! I'm Haizlbliek!
I make the random ideas that occasionally pop into my head.

# Interests
My main interest is coding and game dev, but sometimes I do music.

I am part of an incredible game dev team called GoofyBox Studios (See External Links).

# Main Projects
I've been working on a Chrome extension to add autocompletions to [Glitch](https://glitch.com).
You can find it [Here](https://github.com/Haizlbliek/GlitchAutocompletions).
